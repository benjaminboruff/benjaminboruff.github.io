      <h3>About</h3>
      <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Ben Boruff! This is my personal webpage where I share information about myself, such as my interests, sample  apps, and resume. When I am not coding, I am either out walking or drinking very good coffee. As a matter of fact, I roast my own coffee.</p>
      <p>I have been a Science Fiction fan for as long as I can remember. My father and I used to watch the original Star Trek series reruns when I was a kid. We also spent many hours building model rockets. I believe both of us were influenced by my great-grandmother, who was a big fan of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo programs. </p>
       <p class="pushDown">If you are interested in following me on Twitter, my username is @BenjaminBoruff.</p>
