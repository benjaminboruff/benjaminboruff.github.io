This is my personal website. The site is an Angular 1.4.x SPA.
There are a few issues with the background video player that 
plays a youtube video in the background of the jumbotron (bootstrap).

For some reason, the video is blurry for about 10 seconds on chrome 
(about 45 seconds on Opera), and the video doesn't play at all 
on Ubuntu Linux Firefox (although on Windows Firefox it plays
just fine). 

I'm working on it. And please forgive the typos in my commits - I
type too fast when I'm excited :)
